# Galaxy-WellBeing
The data contains 80 variables that characterize the demographic and socio-economic situation of 181
galaxies over a period of at most 26 years.<br>A composite index is given that measures their well-being.<br>
However, the demographic and socio-economic variables that influence this index is not known. We
seek to determine, what makes the galaxies better off?
